    "- After some iteration and analysis, realized the reason for the poorer performance of the SC model was due to the fact that this model suffers more from precision issues, whereas CB model suffers more from recall issues.\n",

    "- This has the result of increasing the recall of the model, while the re-ranker, if trained optimally, is able to maintain a high precision\n",
    "- For the CB this was the opposite, we kept the number of models smaller (1/2 the number) and the beam size ended up being much smaller - acted as a precision optimization approach"
